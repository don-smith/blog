It feels funny to be doing this again. I can't count the number of times I've set up a new blog. Sometimes I even import older entries. I haven't decided if I'm going to do that here yet.

But strangely enough I realised I had some thoughts to share again. There are huge changes happening in software development at the moment. I fell in love with writing software pretty quickly. And I've spent a lot of time over the past few decades focused on the developer experience and the learning/teaching experience.

With the current use of AI, it's clear we're in changing times, and my curiosity meter is in the red. I have so many questions and experiments to run. I think I've spent enough time over the past year to take others on a learning journey - the learning journey I've designed for myself.

I think it's unique, and I think it has the potential to setup attendees for being resilient and flexible in the changes that are inevidably coming.
