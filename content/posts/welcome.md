# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using Hugo with Docker! This setup provides:

- **Real-time preview** with live reload
- **Docker containerization** for consistent environments
- **Volume mapping** for seamless editing
- **GitHub Actions** for automated deployment

## Getting Started

To start the development server:

```bash
docker-compose up hugo
```

Then visit your blog at the local development URL!

## Writing Posts

Create new posts in the `content/posts/` directory using markdown format. Hugo will automatically detect changes and reload the browser.

Happy blogging! ðŸš€
