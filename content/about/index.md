Hi, thanks for stopping by. I'm Don.

I've been a professional software developer since the mid-90s and am continuing to consult, teach, and build. In addition to applications, sometimes I make music with Supercollider and Strudel.

I'm American, but I've lived in New Zealand for about 14 years. I live in a cohousing community in the north part of the South Island.

I love to build and make things. It's my favourite thing. Walking in the native bush is a very close second. A bit of my background is in electronics so I also love microcontrollers, firmware, and low power/solar communications. I also dabble in hardware synth circuits.

Sometimes I have a thought I'd like to put in a public place - not so others can read it per se (although that's okay too) but more for what it does inside me.

Take care ðŸ‘‹
