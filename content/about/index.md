Hi, thanks for stopping by. I'm Don.

Me? Oh, uh ... I really like software. I've been a dev since the mid-90s and worked with and for some of the largest and smallest software companies in the world. Today I am consulting, teaching, and building with my friends at HYPR. In addition to building applications, sometimes I make music with Supercollider and Strudel.

I'm originally from America (FL), but after living in Europe (NL) and the US (TX, OH, NC, WA), I moved to New Zealand about 14 years ago and am all m done moving around now. I live in a relatively new cohousing community in Golden Bay, an actual paradise. Talk about a learning journey!

I love to build and make things. It's like my favourite thing. Walking in the native bush is a very close second. A bit of my background is in electronics (Biomedial Maintenance) so I have a real love for hardware, gear, microcontrollers, firmware, and low power/solar communications. I also dabble in hardware synthesizer circuits.

Sometimes I have a thought I'd like to put in a public place - not so others can read it per se (although that's okay too) but more for what it does inside me. That's what this place is. Welcome.

Take care ðŸ‘‹
